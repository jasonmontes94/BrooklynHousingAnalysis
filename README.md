# Brooklyn Housing Analysis

Housing in the contemporary era has always provided a vast and diverse set of data. By looking at housing prices within Brooklyn, New York, we can adequately assess the housing market using a variety of tools. Brooklyn is the second most expensive borough, after Manhattan. It's also a highly sought after borough to live in. By applying our analysis to Brooklyn's housing market, it may prove useful to similarly assess other housing markets in the US. It may even be useful to use this analysis for future home buyers who are looking to live in fast growing, highly populated, urban areas.

## Data
Data used in analysis was Brooklyn property sales from 2003-2017 sourced from kaggle.com by Tommy Wu. Original data was taken from the City of New York and cleaned up to be used for analysis.

## Reasearch Questions

- Can we predict future home prices in Brooklyn based on the year that the home was bought?
- Does square footage of Brooklyn homes durastically effect the price of the home?
- How do the neighborhoods compare in pricing within Brooklyn?
- How have prices fluctuated within a specific range of years?
- Are there any other factors that contribute to changes in housing prices?

## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python and Plotly.

### Database Storage
Postgres(SQL) is the database we intend to use.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We are initially choosing a Linear Regression model to compare Brooklyn Home prices with time of sale.

### Dashboard
Tableau will be used to display a dashboard/story. Google Slides is being used as a placeholder for visualization.

## Communication Practices
We will primarily be using Slack for communication. We will also be using Zoom for group coordination on certain tasks. We are all collaborating on various facets of the project; choosing a dataset, building a database, choosing a machine learning model, connecting the database to the model, as well as updating the GitHub and README have been completed together as a team.
